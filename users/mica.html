                    Mica is co-owner of
                    <span class="highlighted-text black">Minesa.</span> She is a

                <br />
                <p>
                    She has consistently demonstrated academic excellence,
                    achieving outstanding results across various subjects since
                    her early years in school. Her commitment to learning began
                    at a young age, and she showcased remarkable aptitude in
                    Science, Math, English, and Filipino during her kindergarten
                    days.
                    <br />
                    Her dedication and pursuit of knowledge continued through
                    elementary school, where she earned recognition as the
                    <strong>outstanding student of the year</strong> and
                    maintained an exceptional performance in English.
                    <br />
                    Her high school years were marked by numerous accolades,
                    including honors for her proficiency in English, Science,
                    History, and MAPEH. Notably, she was also awarded the
                    <strong>artist of the year</strong> for her outstanding
                    creative contributions.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Beyond her academic achievements, she is equally dedicated
                    to her personal life. Neo, her boyfriend, is the fortunate
                    recipient of her talkative and loving nature. Their
                    relationship is a testament to her ability to balance her
                    academic excellence with a vibrant and warm personality.

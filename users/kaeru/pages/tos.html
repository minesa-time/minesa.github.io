                    <h2>Service Providers</h2>

                    <p>
                        We may employ third-party companies and individuals due
                        to the following reasons:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We want to inform our users that these third parties
                        have access to your personal information. The reason is
                        to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf.
                        However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the
                        information for any other purpose.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Security</h2>

                    <p>
                        We value your trust in providing us your personal
                        information, thus we are striving to use commercially
                        acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no
                        method of transmission over the internet, or method of
                        electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we
                        cannot guarantee its absolute security.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Our service may contain links to other sites. If you
                        click on a third-party link, you will be directed to
                        that site. Note that these external sites are not

                        We do not knowingly collect personal identifiable
                        information from children under 13. In the case we
                        discover that a child under 13 has provided us with
                        personal information, we immediately delete this from
                        our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are
